          <p>Hi, my name is Lucas. I'm a <span className='font-extrabold'>Computer Engineering</span> student with a passion for <span className='font-extrabold'>Software Engineering</span>.</p>
          <p>I'm currently pursuing <span className='font-extrabold'>Computer Engineering</span> at <span className='font-extrabold'>UA </span> (Universidad Americana), located in Asuncion, Paraguay.</p>
          <p>I'm a full-stack developer, specializing in the <span className='font-extrabold'>MERN</span> stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node), and I'm keen on building high-quality, scalable web applications.</p>
          <p>My approach to application development is based on several core principles. I prioritize creating <span className='font-extrabold'>modern</span> user interfaces that are visually <span className='font-extrabold'>appealing</span> and easy to use. Additionally, I am committed to ensuring that every application I build performs <span className='font-extrabold'>optimally </span>and is <span className='font-extrabold'>user-friendly</span>.</p>
          <p>I continuously improve my skills and knowledge by tackling complex challenges and collaborating with others to find creative solutions.</p>
